            The global cyber threat continues to evolve at a rapid pace. with a
            rising number of data breaches each year. A report by risk based
            security revealed that a shocking 7.9 billion records have been
            exposed by data breaches in the first nine months of 2019 alone.
            This figure is more than double (112%) the number of records exposed
            in the same period in 2018. Medical services, retailers and public
            entities experienced the most breaches, with malicious criminals
            responsible for most incidents. Some of these sectors are more
            appealing to cybercriminals because they collect financial and
            medical data, but all businesses that use networks can be targeted
            for customer data, corporate espionage, or customer attacks With the
            scale of the cyber threat set to continue to rise, the international
            data corporation predicts that worldwide spending on cyber-security
            solutions will reach a massive $1337 billion by 2022. Governments
            across the globe have responded to the rising cyber threat with
            guidance to help organizations implement effective cyber-security
            practices.
